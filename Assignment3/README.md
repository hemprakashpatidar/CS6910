Assignment 3 Readme

[myrnn.py](https://github.com/hemprakashpatidar/CS6910/blob/main/Assignment3/myrnn.py) This is main Program

[trainData.py](https://github.com/hemprakashpatidar/CS6910/blob/main/Assignment3/trainData.py) This will generate train data using seq2seq

[model_.py](https://github.com/hemprakashpatidar/CS6910/blob/main/Assignment3/model_.py) This is the model we are building using keras and compile and training is also done and saving the model

[loadModel.py](https://github.com/hemprakashpatidar/CS6910/blob/main/Assignment3/loadModel.py) Load the save model

[decodeSeq.py](https://github.com/hemprakashpatidar/CS6910/blob/main/Assignment3/decodeSeq.py) To output the devanagiri sequence from given latin input

[TestData.py](https://github.com/hemprakashpatidar/CS6910/blob/main/Assignment3/TestData.py) Generating test data to test thr accuracy of model

[Prediction.py](https://github.com/hemprakashpatidar/CS6910/blob/main/Assignment3/Prediction.py) For predicting some words in devnagiri
